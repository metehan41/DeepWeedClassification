# DeepWeedClassification

This text discusses the critical role of fertilizers in
crop production but highlights the risks posed by
chemical fertilizers containing harmful heavy met-
als. It briefly touches on the benefits of organic
fertilizers as a solution, noting the difficulty for
some farmers in adopting this approach. The main
focus shifts to a proposed research topic: ”Weed
Classification for Robotic Agriculture using Ma-
chine Learning.” This project aims to create a
machine learning model to identify and classify
weeds in agricultural fields, aiding in targeted
weed control by agricultural robots. The objec-
tive is to reduce pesticide use, promote organic
farming, and support sustainable agriculture prac-
tices. The text emphasizes the potential of such a
model in real-time weed identification, leading to
decreased pesticide application and the promotion
of eco-friendly farming techniques like organic
farming, which avoids synthetic inputs in favor
of natural pest control and nutrient optimization
