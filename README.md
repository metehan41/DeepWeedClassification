Weed Classification for Robotic Agriculture

Fertilizers play a crucial role in enhancing crop production
and ensuring bountiful harvests. However, overreliance on
chemical fertilizers poses risks to both human health and
the environment. These substances often contain harmful
heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, and uranium,
which can inflict damage on vital organs such as the kidneys,
liver, and lungs. Moreover, these heavy metals are linked to
various other health hazards. These damages not only affect
today but can also have irreversible consequences on nature
in the future. One of the main solutions to all this harm is
the usage of organic fertilizer but it could be hard for some
of the farmers. We will not dive into details since we are
not experts in terms of farming.
The proposed research topic is “Weed Classification for
Robotic Agriculture using Machine Learning”. The primary
aim of this project is to develop a machine-learning model
that can accurately identify and classify different types of
weeds in agricultural fields. The output from this model will
be used to guide agricultural robots to carry out targeted

weed control, reducing the use of pesticides and promoting
organic farming practices. This is particularly relevant in
the context of sustainable agriculture, where minimizing the
use of harmful chemicals is a key objective.
The machine learning model developed in this project will
be trained to recognize different types of weeds and classify
them appropriately. This will enable the agricultural robots
to identify the weeds in real-time and carry out targeted
weed control. As a result, the amount of pesticide used
can be significantly reduced, leading to more sustainable
farming practices. Organic farming relies on ecologically
sound pest control methods and primarily utilizes biological
fertilizers derived from animal waste and nitrogen-fixing
cover crops. This approach consciously avoids synthetic
inputs like pesticides, fertilizers, and hormones, opting in-
stead for techniques such as crop rotation, organic waste
utilization, farm manure, rock additives, and crop residues
to protect plants and optimize nutrient utilization. Organic
farming stands as a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative
to conventional agricultural practices, garnering increasing
popularity on a global scale
